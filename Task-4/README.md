## Prime Factorizor
In primary mathematics we are taught to find ou the *prime factorization* of a number. In one line it means all the factors into its broken form with the powers with which it is multiplied.

This program is very simple and deals with 4 small steps of finding the factors
* Checking if the number is prime,
* Finding if the fator we are considering is prime,
* Checking the number of times the *prime* factor divides the number,
* And at last, finding all such numbers and placing them all together.

This program will be written in C++ Language.

We have to keep in mind the writing of powers in a correct way.
We are going to use a separate `function` for finding if the number is prime or the factors are prime. 
We have to repeat the process couple of times so we will be using `for` loops. 
We will keep all of our operations to `integers`.
>Does prime number exists in fraction? Have to give a thought...

It will be easy for students to check the factorization of big numbers and even find if a number is prime or not.

> Prime numbers are really one of the most simple facintating thing one can thing of. 

Hope you will like the program.
